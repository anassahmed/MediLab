# MediLab Organizer

A simple online web app to run medical laboratories. It's my first experience with web development using Python, Okasha and Elixir.

The reason behind this app is that my cousin (he's medical analysis specialist) had requested this app from me and provieded me some requirements and features he needed in this app.

This app is not under development and it's not for practical usage. It's meant for learning and educational purposes only.

## Features

- List of Clients stored alongside with theri phones, addresses and other information.
- List of Bills includes information about payments and reports.
- List of Reports includes results of medical analysis and patient information. It's also printable.
- List of Templates which is used to store medical analysis items and normal values related to specific gender and age.
